# My tmux config

Based on the Youtube video The Zen tmux Config at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzNmUNvnB04

The tmux.config file needs to be put in the folder ~/.config/tmux as tmux.conf

The tpm Tmux Plugin Manager needs to be installed as per the installation instructions at [https://github.com/tmux-plugins/tpm](https://github.com/tmux-plugins/tpm)

To install the plugins specified in the config file you need to use the prefix key binding (in this case Ctrl + Space and not the default Ctrl + b) then a capital I.
